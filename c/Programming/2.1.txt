Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what Spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand!
In other words, darling, kiss me!
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true!
In other words, I love you!

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what Spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand!
In other words, darling, kiss me!
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true!
In other words, I love you!
Take Me To Your Heart
Are we lovers
Or only just friends
Come tomorrow
Will I be lonely again
When you see me
Is it love in your eyes
What you feeling
Deep down inside
Do you think about me (think about me)
When I'm far away
Do you dream about me (dream about me)
Can I find a way
To make you want me (make you want me)
The way I want you
Cos I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say now
Take Me To Your Heart
Are we lovers
Or only just friends
Come tomorrow
Will I be lonely again
When you see me
