Take Me To Your Heart
Are we lovers
Or only just friends
Come tomorrow
Will I be lonely again
When you see me
Is it love in your eyes
What you feeling
Deep down inside
Do you think about me (think about me)
When I'm far away
Do you dream about me (dream about me)
Can I find a way
To make you want me (make you want me)
The way I want you
Cos I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say now
Take Me To Your Heart
Are we lovers
Or only just friends
Come tomorrow
Will I be lonely again
When you see me
Is it love in your eyes
What you feeling
Deep down inside
Do you think about me (think about me)
When I'm far away
Do you dream about me (dream about me)
Can I find a way
To make you want me (make you want me)
The way I want you
Cos I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say now
